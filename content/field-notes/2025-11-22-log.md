## Incident Summary

Attempted optimization of the CI/CD build pipeline resulted in deployment failures and rollback to previous version.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Configuration Error**: Incorrect webpack configuration syntax in production build settings
- **Dependency Conflict**: Async/await incompatibility between build tools and runtime environment
- **Insufficient Testing**: Staging environment did not catch the production-specific failure

### Technical Details
```bash
Error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'const' in /dist/bundle.js
```

The issue occurred when attempting to optimize bundle splitting for better caching:
- Modified chunk splitting strategy
- Added code splitting for vendor libraries
- Enabled aggressive tree-shaking

### Impact
- Production deployment blocked for 2 hours
- User-facing application temporarily unavailable
- Development velocity impacted while debugging

### Recovery Actions Taken
1. ❌ Rollback to version 2.1.4 (stable baseline)
2. ❌ Disable bundle optimization features temporarily
3. ❌ Identify and isolate the problematic configuration changes
4. ❌ Deploy fix for webpack configuration syntax

## Lessons Learned
- Always test build optimizations in staging environment that mirrors production
- Implement gradual rollout for build configuration changes
- Consider feature flags for experimental build optimizations
- Improve error logging in CI/CD pipeline for faster diagnosis

### Preventive Measures
- Implement unit tests for build configuration
- Add smoke tests post-deployment
- Review build changes in dedicated PR with required approvals
