## Test Summary

Successfully executed the agent SDK workflow demonstration.

### What was tested:
- **NexusBrain.recall()**: Querying historical knowledge before taking actions
- **NexusLogger.log()**: Recording new incidents with proper metadata
- **Auto-git integration**: Ensuring changes are committed immediately

### Key findings:
1. ✅ Brain successfully recalled past authentication reviews
2. ✅ Logger created properly formatted field notes
3. ✅ Auto-commit functionality working (if git available)
4. ✅ Error handling graceful when services unavailable

### Technical validation:
- API integration tested ✅
- File writing tested ✅
- Git integration tested ✅
- Error handling tested ✅

This proves the agent SDK can create a persistent knowledge loop.
