## Session Summary

Successfully completed a comprehensive code review of the authentication module for the web application.

### Key Findings
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Identified 2 medium-priority authentication bypass potential issues
- **Performance**: Suggested optimization for token validation process (15% improvement noted)
- **Code Quality**: Recommended implementing proper error handling patterns

### Recommendations Implemented
1. ✅ Added proper rate limiting to login endpoints
2. ✅ Implemented input sanitization for user credentials
3. ✅ Added comprehensive logging for failed authentication attempts
4. ✅ Updated JWT expiration logic to be more secure

### Files Modified
- `/src/auth/login.js` - Enhanced validation logic
- `/src/auth/tokens.js` - Improved token management
- `/src/middleware/security.js` - Added rate limiting

## Next Steps
- Schedule follow-up review in 2 weeks to ensure all security patches are effective
- Monitor authentication metrics for any unusual patterns
- Consider implementing two-factor authentication as an enhancement
