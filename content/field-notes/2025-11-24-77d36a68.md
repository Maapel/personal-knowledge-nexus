Istio sidecar injection failed during deployment. Traffic routing temporarily broken for 15 minutes.

Service mesh deployment caused traffic blackholing due to incorrect sidecar injection configuration. Root cause: Version mismatch between Istio control plane and data plane. Emergency mitigation: Disabled problematic sidecar injection, rolled back problematic pods. Preventative: Added stricter validation for service mesh configuration changes.
