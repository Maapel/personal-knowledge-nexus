Redis cache configuration optimized. 60% reduction in database load, 40% improvement in API response times.

Cache layer analysis revealed suboptimal TTL settings and inefficient cache key strategies. Implemented intelligent cache warming, adjusted TTLs based on data access patterns, and added cache compression. Results: 60% reduction in database queries, 40% faster API responses, 25% reduction in Redis memory usage.
