Container resource limits optimized based on monitoring data. 20% reduction in cloud costs achieved.

Resource usage analysis showed over-provisioned containers across multiple services. Implemented HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) with proper resource requests/limits based on actual usage patterns. Added detailed monitoring and alerting for resource saturation. Result: 20% reduction in cloud infrastructure costs while maintaining performance.
