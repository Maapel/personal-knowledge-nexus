E2E test suite execution time reduced from 45 minutes to 12 minutes through parallelization and selective running.

E2E test suite was causing CI bottlenecks with slow execution times. Analysis showed serial execution and redundant test scenarios. Solutions: Implemented parallel test execution, added intelligent test selection based on code changes, streamlined test data management. Benefits: Faster feedback cycles, reduced CI costs, maintained test effectiveness.
