Refactored authentication middleware to reduce token validation time by 35%. Implemented caching for frequently used public keys.

The authentication service was experiencing slowdowns during peak hours. Analysis showed that JWT verification was a bottleneck, requiring expensive cryptographic operations on every request. Implemented Redis caching for public keys and optimized the validation algorithm. Results: 35% reduction in auth response time, 50% reduction in CPU usage for auth service.
