Completed comprehensive review of database queries. All endpoints now properly parameterized with no injection vulnerabilities.

Performed security audit of all user-facing database operations. Found 3 instances of insufficient parameterization in legacy code. Applied prepared statements and input sanitization. Updated ORM configurations to prevent SQL injection by default.
