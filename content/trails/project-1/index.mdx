# Welcome to Reinforcement Learning

This trail covers the fundamental concepts, algorithms, and practical implementations of reinforcement learning.

## Key Concepts

- **Agent-Environment Interaction**
- **Reward Functions and Rewards**
- **State and Action Spaces**
- **Policy and Value Functions**

## Main Algorithms

1. **Q-Learning** - Model-free reinforcement learning
2. **SARSA** - On-policy temporal difference learning
3. **Deep Q Networks (DQN)** - Neural network approximation
4. **Policy Gradient Methods** - Direct policy optimization
5. **Actor-Critic Methods** - Combining value and policy approaches

## Practical Implementation

### Getting Started with Python
```python
import gym
import numpy as np

# Create environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Reset environment
state = env.reset()
print(f"Initial state: {state}")
```

### Key Libraries
- **OpenAI Gym** - Environment for RL experiments
- **Stable Baselines3** - High-quality implementations
- **Ray RLlib** - Scalable distributed RL

## Advanced Topics

This section covers cutting-edge research and applications:

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinating multiple learning agents
